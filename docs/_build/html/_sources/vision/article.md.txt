## Expanding Across Domains

The future of AI evaluation demands more than just static datasets and predefined test cases. Our vision for the Karta Context Engine is to  expand across multiple domains , ensuring AI agents are rigorously tested in dynamic, real-world environments. While we began with  e-commerce , our goal is to introduce datasets and evaluation scenarios across industries such as  finance, healthcare, logistics, and customer service . Each new domain will bring domain-specific tasks, real-world constraints, and nuanced interactions that reflect the complexities AI agents must navigate.

## Weekly Data Drops & Evolving Scenarios

AI models should not be tested against stagnant datasets . Business environments evolve rapidly, and AI agents must  adapt to changing conditions . To ensure continuous relevance, the Karta Context Engine will provide weekly data drops , encapsulating  new market trends, shifting user behaviors, and emerging challenges . These updates will allow AI systems to be evaluated not just against  historical data , but in the context of  evolving real-world scenarios , enabling more robust and future-proof AI deployments.

## A Full-Fledged User Simulator

Realistic AI evaluation requires  realistic user behavior modeling . Our vision includes a  full-fledged user simulator , capable of dynamically generating  contextual, multi-turn conversations, unpredictable user interactions, and complex decision-making flows . This simulator will allow AI developers and testers to expose their models to  adaptive, human-like interactions , ensuring AI agents are resilient, responsive, and effective under various conditions.

## The Karta Playground: Unified AI Testing & Benchmarking

To streamline AI evaluation, we aim to develop an  interactive testing interface —the  Karta Playground . This platform will provide a single-pane-of-glass view where engineers, product managers, and operations teams can  run AI evaluations, compare performance metrics, and visualize agent decision-making in real-time . It will support  custom test case generation, multi-metric analysis, and real-time debugging , allowing teams to iterate faster and build AI systems that meet the highest standards of reliability and performance.

## A Future of Safe & Scalable AI

At Karta, we believe that representative task simulations are the foundation of  trustworthy AI . Our long-term goal is to create an ecosystem where AI teams can  confidently evaluate, iterate, and deploy models in complex, high-stakes environments . By combining  domain breadth, dynamic datasets, user simulation, and comprehensive evaluation tools , the Karta Context Engine will set the gold standard for AI testing—empowering organizations to build safer, smarter, and more effective AI systems.
