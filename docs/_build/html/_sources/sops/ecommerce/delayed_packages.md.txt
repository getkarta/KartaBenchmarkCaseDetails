# Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Handling Delayed Packages

## Scope

This SOP applies to all customer service agents handling cases where an order has not been delivered by the promised date, and the customer is inquiring about its status.

---

## Process Flow

### Step 1: Identify the Customer

* Ask the customer for their registered email address.
* Verify customer identity using internal systems.

### Step 2: Retrieve Order Details

* Locate the order using the provided email address.
* Find the package that contains the customers item using the item numbers associated with each package.
* Check the current tracking status of the package.

### Step 3: Communicate the Status to the Customer

* Inform the customer of the latest tracking status.
* If the package is still marked as "Out for Delivery," acknowledge the delay and apologize for the inconvenience.

### Step 4: Address Customer Concerns

* If the customer simply asks for an update, provide the available tracking information.
* If the customer expresses frustration and insists that the package is important and needed for an occasion, proceed to the resolution step.

### Step 5: Offer Compensation (if applicable)

* If the package is delayed beyond the promised date and the customer emphasizes its importance, offer a gift card equivalent to the shipping cost of the package.
* Ensure that the offer is communicated politely and empathetically.

### Step 6: Confirm Resolution

* If the customer accepts the gift card, process the issuance and provide confirmation.
* If the customer remains dissatisfied and requests further action, escalate the case to a human representative.

* **Escalate promptly** if the customer remains dissatisfied after the gift card offer.

## Compliance & Review
