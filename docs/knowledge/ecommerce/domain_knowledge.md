## General Rules

#### Change to Customer Information

Customer email and customer phone number cannot be updated. The customer will have to create a new account in case the email needs to be changed.

#### Fraudulent Customers

Potentially fraudulent customers are tagged in the customer dataset where the `is_fraud_flag` is set to `true` such customers have to be handled carefully. Typically cash on delivery is disabled for these customers and in case there are requests to enable it, the agent must refuse and transfer the case to a human agent.
